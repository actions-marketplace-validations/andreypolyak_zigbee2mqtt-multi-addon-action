## Usage

This action will automatically run every 30 minutes and check if any updates to the original Zigbee2mqtt are available. If they would be found action will update version in your repository accordingly.

To create new Zigbee2mqtt add-ons after initial setup open your workflow (.github/workflows/main.yml by default) and change the addon_names variable. Don't forget to separate add-on names with a comma.
